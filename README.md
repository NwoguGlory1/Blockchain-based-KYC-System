## Overview

The Blockchain-based KYC System is designed to provide a decentralized solution for businesses to verify customer identities. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system ensures transparency, security, and immutability of KYC data while allowing approved businesses to perform verifications.

## Features

- Customer registration and data management
- Business approval and revocation by contract owner
- Customer verification by approved businesses
- Privacy-preserving data access controls
- Transparent and immutable record-keeping

## Smart Contract

The core of this system is a Clarity smart contract. Clarity is a decidable smart contract language used by blockchains like Stacks. The contract includes the following main functions:

- `add-customer`: Register a new customer
- `verify-customer`: Verify a customer's identity
- `approve-business`: Approve a business to perform verifications
- `revoke-business`: Revoke a business's approval
- `get-customer-details`: Retrieve customer information
- `is-customer-verified`: Check if a customer is verified
- `is-business-approved`: Check if a business is approved

## Getting Started

To use this smart contract, you'll need to deploy it to a Clarity-compatible blockchain network. Follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary tools for your chosen blockchain platform (e.g., Clarinet for Stacks).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NwoguGlory1/blockchain-kyc-system.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd blockchain-kyc-system
   ```
4. Deploy the smart contract to your chosen network using the appropriate tools and commands.

## Usage

After deploying the contract, you can interact with it using the blockchain platform's SDK or CLI tools. Here are some example interactions:

1. Add a new customer:
   ```
   (contract-call? .kyc-system add-customer "John Doe" u19900101 "USA")
   ```

2. Approve a business:
   ```
   (contract-call? .kyc-system approve-business 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM "Verify Co.")
   ```

3. Verify a customer:
   ```
   (contract-call? .kyc-system verify-customer u1 u1)
   ```

4. Check if a customer is verified:
   ```
   (contract-call? .kyc-system is-customer-verified u1)
   ```

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that only authorized entities have access to the contract owner's keys.
- Regularly audit the list of approved businesses.
- Consider implementing additional layers of encryption for sensitive customer data.
- Be mindful of potential privacy concerns with on-chain data storage.
